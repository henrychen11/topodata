### Proposal
This project is to show the average salary (wage) in the United States by state and by industry. I would like to add the ability to display historical data backing to 2011 if possible. Users will have the ability to filter by industry and also select the year. When they hover over each state, a tooltip will appear that shows the following items:

- State
- Job Title
- Max Salary
- Median Salary
- Min Salary
